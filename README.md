# fidode07.github.io
This is my portfolio. A page with my projects, info about me and more.

# ðŸ˜® Facts about the site ðŸ˜®
- Dark-mode recognition
- Fast loading times by loading css and js after the page is loaded
- Responsive (Who comes up with such crazy ideas)
- Fast loading times, because I put everything in the index.html instead of linking to new files
- The site calculates my age, so I don't have to keep updating it
- I made the background picture by myself
